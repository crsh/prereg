<!-- Goal of extended fMRI preregistration template**

The goal of this template is to provide sufficient information in preregistration for fMRI data design to increase reproducible reporting practices. 

Text was adopted from the OSF preregistration challenge template to include the details important for fMRI psychology design. OSF template is retained in some areas and edited in other areas to incorporate both prior published templates and guidelines (Nichols et al., 2016; Poldrack et al., 2008; van't Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016).

Quick notes:
All prompts and tables can be used to fill in as it, or as a checklist of information you include for text for that section or checklist for attached files (e.g., json file of scan parameters). 

**Tip: Using it as a checklist will allow you to write these sections as they will appear in your future paper.**

If a certain table/section does not apply, can just state "N/A." 

This is also a base template and will not be sufficient for every type of fMRI analysis. If your methods require additional checklists, please include! -->

## Exisiting Data
<!-- Preregistration is designed to make clear the distinction between confirmatory tests, specified prior to seeing the data, and exploratory analyses conducted after observing the data. Therefore, creating a research plan in which existing data will be used presents unique challenges. Please select the description that best describes your situation. -->

- Registration prior to creation of data

- Registration prior to any human observation of the data

-	Registration prior to accessing the data

-	Registration prior to analysis of the data

-	Registration following analysis of the data


## Explanation of Exisiting Data
<!-- If you indicate that you will be using some data that already exist in this study, please describe the steps you have taken to assure that you are unaware of any patterns or summary statistics in the data. This may include an explanation of how access to the data has been limited, who has observed the data, or how you have avoided observing any analysis of the specific data you will use in your study. The purpose of this question is to assure that the line between confirmatory and exploratory analysis is clear.
e.g., links to prior papers, osf project page, prior posters or talks, or descriptions. -->

## Follow-up Analyses
<!-- If not specified previously, will you be conducting any confirmatory analyses to follow up on effects in your statistical model, such as subgroup analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, or follow-up tests from interactions? Remember that any analyses not specified in this research plan must be noted as exploratory. -->

Enter your response here.


## Exploratory Analyses 
<!-- If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time. -->
